# elevator
An elevator company needs a control system for its next generation elevator. The control system
determines the destination floors of lifts based on which floors the passengers press the lift buttons.
It is possible to select the desired floor inside the lift, and to call the lift with a button on the wall
outside on each floor. It will be possible to press several buttons so that an elevator can run to several floors
before stopping on the last selected floor.
